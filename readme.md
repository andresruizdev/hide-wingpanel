# Hide wingpanel
Hi, Here is a so (rly) simple script to manage **hide** and **show** **wingpanel**.  
**wingpanel** is the top panel in elementary os.  
It tested on **elementary os 0.4**. 2017.

I just noticed that some users want to **hide** the **wingpanel** (including myself), and there is no option available to do this.  
so i just did this with simple **killall** and **start**.
